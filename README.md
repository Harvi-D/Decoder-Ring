# Decoder_Ring_Project_1
Decoder ring project for thinkful.

Contains three different encoder/decoder options.

1) Caesar Cypher: Will move however many letters you specify. If encode is true, it will encode the message. Ex: "random", with 3, encode = true: "udqgrp". If encode is false, it will decode the message. Ex: "udqgrp" with -3, encode = false: "random".

2) Substitution: Allows user to make their own alphabet to substitute the regular alphabet. Ex: "QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM" would replace "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".

3) Polybius: Allows user to encode using a polybius square. Look up polybius for more information.
